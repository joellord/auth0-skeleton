# Auth0 Skeleton app
A very simple application that uses Auth0 to access protected routes on an API.

# Setup

Start by adding your Auth0 configurations in `/front/config.js` and `/api/config.js`.

## Front end 
The front-end is in the `/front` folder.  You can start it with `server` or any other static http server.

```
> cd front
> serve
```

## API
The API is in the `/api` folder.  You can start it with `npm start`.  Make sure you run `npm install` first.

```
> cd api
> npm install
> npm start
```
